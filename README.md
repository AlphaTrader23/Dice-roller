# Dice-roller

My dice roller project is a cool creation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With HTML, I set up the structure of the webpage, CSS made it look stylish, and JavaScript handled the dice rolling logic. Players can virtually roll dice on my project, bringing the fun of dice games to the digital world. Keeping up the good work with coding projects, and if you need code or details, feel free to reach out me.
